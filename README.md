# Homework_05_Day_Planner

Here is a functional day planner. The time of day will determine the background color of each time block. When you click the save button, the text input typed into the text box will be saved to local storage so that when the page is refreshed the text will still appear in its last saved time slot. The date is also given for the current day at the top of the webpage.
